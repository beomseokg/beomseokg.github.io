About Me

Hello! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Saibal Mukhopadhyay. My current research is in learning representation, relation, and prediction of multi-agent systems using deep learning in a data-efficient and computation-effient manner.
